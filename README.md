# Make your world a work of art

Paint the air with just your browser and your hands using AIrbrush

## How the "magic" happens

Using a tensorflow.js library, PoseNet, we track your movements and let you draw with your hands.

If using our app with Chrome, you may use speech to control your drawing tool, which we integrated using the browser speech API. This technology is in the early stages of development, so speech capability remains TK for other browsers
