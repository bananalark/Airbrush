        <p>
          Airbrush is an interactive canvas that allows users to share their
          creations on Facebook. Airbrush does not collect photo album data from
          a user's Facebook account. It will only post to a user's album when
          the user consents to post a given image through the Airbrush UI. it
          does not disclose or use private personal information. Details of this
          policy may be revised or expanded as Airbrush continues to develop.
